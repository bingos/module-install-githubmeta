NAME
    Module::Install::GithubMeta - A Module::Install extension to include
    GitHub meta information in META.yml

SYNOPSIS
      # In Makefile.PL

      use inc::Module::Install;
      githubmeta;

    The "repository" and "homepage" meta in "META.yml" will be set
    accordingly.

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Install::GithubMeta is a Module::Install extension to include
    GitHub <http://github.com> meta information in "META.yml".

    It automatically detects if the distribution directory is under "git"
    version control and whether the "origin" is a GitHub repository and will
    set the "repository" and "homepage" meta in "META.yml" to the
    appropriate URLs for GitHub.

COMMANDS
    This plugin adds the following Module::Install command:

    "githubmeta"
        Does nothing on the user-side. On the author-side it will
        auto-detect if the directory is under "git" version control and
        whether the "origin" is a GitHub repository. Will set "repository"
        to the public clone URL and "homepage" to the http GitHub link for
        the repository.

        You may override the "homepage" setting by using the Module::Install
        "homepage" command prior to calling this command.

          use inc::Module::Install;
          homepage 'http://mymoduleshomepage.com/';
          githubmeta;
